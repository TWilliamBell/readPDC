Authors@R: 
    person(given = "TW",
           family = "Bell",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "t4bell@uwaterloo.ca")
Description: Developed in the aftermath of realizing that I had written complex numbers to a file that neither Python (inc. Pandas!) nor R could read by default.
