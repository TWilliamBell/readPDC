# readPDC
A package that does one thing: read complex Pandas csv files into R.  Pandas formatting for complex data is not even read in by Pandas functions, but I figured it would be simpler for me to work with it in R anyways, so I've written some code for parsing it into the formatting of an R complex format.  Could be used by a Python user for the Python equivalent.
